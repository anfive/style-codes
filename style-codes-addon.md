# Style Codes Add-on

The INCOM Style Codes add-on is an add-on for Google Sheets that adds utility functions to encode and decode style codes.

The add-on does not collect any data.

Add-ons with custom functions can't even be tested unless they are published, see https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36763437
so I have to write this page. Well done...
